# Layer Definitions
obstacle_layer:
  obstacle_range: 7     # The default maximum distance from the robot at which an obstacle will be inserted
                          # into the cost map in meters. This can be over-ridden on a per-sensor basis. Default: 2.5
  raytrace_range: 4.0   # The default range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the
                          # map using sensor data. This can be over-ridden on a per-sensor basis. Default: 3.0
