# picture_to_coordinates

This is the package that deprojects pixels into the world coordinates of the CAMERA frame. To run it with the realsense and YOLO, you also need to those packages.

My publisher is a simple publisher that publishes simulated YOLOv4 detection in the darknet_ros_msg/BoundingBoxes format.
